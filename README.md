Loopshape/TYPO3_Loopshape-org


This website is dedicated to webdesign and multimedia!

Loopshape.org is my personal development server for creating and testing all kind of applications, which I found in the web and which could be usable for future reference.
I found a lot of useful tools and plugins around the net and this server is dedicated to be a hybrid between a development archive and a platform for further programming actions.
My goal is to reach an better level of understanding, how all the web technologies are working together to speed up the building process of a website and to have more knowledge about combining these technics together to a multilevel-communication-alrounder.

I hope, you'll like this project as much as I do and maybe you've got the same interests to build websites faster and more effective!

Kind regards 
Arjuna Noorsanto, {Webmaster}
